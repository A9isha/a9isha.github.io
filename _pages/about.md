Hi! I am Anisha and welcome to my webpage. I am currently working in Microsoft in Redmond, WA as an Applied Machine Learning Engineer in Azure Security Machine Learning team. I received my PhD in Computer Science from Arizona State University in 2016 under the guidance of Dr. Arunabha Sen. Prior to that I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata in 2012.
